Wildlife Tracker System
This project implements a Wildlife Tracker System designed to manage wildlife populations, their habitats, and migration patterns. The system allows users to register, update, and manage animals, habitats, and migration events. The implementation employs a modular design with a Manager/Mediator Pattern for clear separation of responsibilities and better maintainability.

Features
Animal Management: Register, update, and track specific animals.
Habitat Management: Create and manage habitats, assign animals to habitats, and manage habitat properties like size, environment, and location.
Migration Management: Manage migration paths, scheduling, and tracking of animal movements between habitats.
